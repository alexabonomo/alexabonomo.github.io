# portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio. This will be an ongoing project to showcase my digital design and creative development skills.

Here's the thing.
I am a jack of all trades.
I dabble in all sorts of media. 


This is a place where I will not only show my creative programming progress, but as well as my more traditional mediums. 
At the moment I am unsure what this whole site will look like, but if you do look at my page. Just know this is an ever growing piece in itself. 

Whether you are my friend or a future coworker, we are all friends as long as you are on my site. And I'll always be down to email, chat, and explore!
